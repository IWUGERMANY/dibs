Welcome to the `dibs_computing_core` wiki!

## Prerequisites

Before running this program, ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed on your system. If Python is not already
installed, you can download and install it from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Installing Python

1. Visit the [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/) page.
2. Choose the version appropriate for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux) and click on the download link.
3. Run the installer and follow the installation instructions.
4. During the installation process, make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to **PATH**" or "Add Python to
   environment variables" to ensure Python is added to your system **PATH**.
5. Once the installation is complete, open a command prompt or terminal and type  
`python --version` to verify that Python is installed correctly.

## Installation Guide
To install the module `dibs_computing_core` use the command `pip` like this: 

```bash
pip install dibs_computing_core == 1.0.0
```
