<!-- Welcome to the Project Overview!

This project consists of four packages designed to facilitate building simulation tasks:

1. **dibs_computing_core**: This package contains the core calculation functionality for building simulations.
2. **dibs_datasource_csv**: It provides utilities to handle CSV files, which are commonly used as data sources in building simulations.
3. **dibs_data**: This package contains data that aids in building simulation tasks.
4. **dibs_cli**: A command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows users to simulate buildings using the functionality provided by dibs_computing_core.

For more detailed information on each package and its functionalities, please refer to the README.md of each package:

Welcome to the Dynamic ISO Building Simulator (DIBS) Overview!
The DIBS project consists of four packages designed to facilitate building simulation tasks:
1.	**dibs_computing_core**: This package contains the core calculation functionality for the building simulations.
2.	**dibs_datasource_csv**: It provides utilities to handle CSV input files, which are commonly used as data sources in the default input file type for DIBS building simulations.
3.	**dibs_data**: This package contains auxiliary data, such as occupancy schedules or weather files, required for the  that aids in building simulation tasks.
4.	**dibs_cli**: A provides a command-line interface (CLI) tool that which allows users to simulate buildings using the functionality provided by dibs_computing_core.
